{{CSSRef}}{{seecompattable}}

The **`inset-area`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property enables an **anchor-positioned** element to be positioned relative to the edges of its associated **anchor element** by placing the positioned element on one or more tiles of an implicit 3x3 grid called the **inset-area grid**. This provides an alternative to positioning an element relative to its anchor via inset properties and the {{cssxref("anchor()")}} function.

### Values

The following sections explain in detail the different types of keywords that can be used in `inset-area` values.

> **Note:** Generally, you can't mix different types in one value, e.g. physical and logical. To do so results in invalid values. For example, `inset-area: bottom inline-end` is not a valid value because it mixes physical and logical keywords.

#### Physical grid keywords

These keywords specify the position of the element on the `inset-area` grid using physical values, i.e. its position/direction will be unaffected by {{cssxref("writing-mode")}} or {{cssxref("direction")}} settings.

- Physical row and column keywords

  - : You can specify one keyword from each of the two lists below to position the element in a single specific grid tile:

    - `top`, `center`, or `bottom`: Position the element in the top, center, or bottom row of the grid.
    - `left`, `center`, or `right`: Position the element in the left-hand, center, or right-hand column of the grid.

      For example, `top left` places the element in the top left tile, while `center right` places it in the center row and right-hand column.

- Physical spanning keywords

  - : You can specify one physical row or column keyword, and an appropriate physical spanning keyword. The element is initially placed in the center of the specified row or column, and it then spans in the direction specified in the spanning keyword, spanning two grid tiles:

    - `span-left`: Cause the element to span the center column and the left-hand column of the grid.
    - `span-right`: Cause the element to span the center column and the right-hand column of the grid.
    - `span-top`: Cause the element to span the center row and the top row of the grid.
    - `span-bottom`: Cause the element to span the center row and the bottom row of the grid.

      For example, `top span-left` causes the element to be spanned over the top center and top left of the anchor.

      > **Note:** Trying to pair a row or column keyword with an inappropriate spanning keyword will result in an invalid property value. For example, `right span-right` is invalid — you can't place the element in the right-hand column and then try to span further to the right.

If only a single physical keyword is specified in the `inset-area` value, the other value is implied as follows:

- `left`, `right`, `top`, or `bottom`
  - : The other value defaults to [`span-all`](#span-all), causing the element to span all three tiles of the grid or row it was initially placed in. For example, `left` is equivalent to `left span-all`.
- `span-left`, `span-right`, `span-top`, or `span-bottom`
  - : The other value defaults to `center`. For example, `span-left` is equivalent to `center span-left`.

#### Logical grid keywords

These keywords specify the position of the element on the `inset-area` grid using logical values, i.e. its position/direction will be relative to {{cssxref("writing-mode")}} and/or {{cssxref("direction")}} settings on either the element itself (the `self` keywords) or the element's [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block) (the non-`self` keywords).

- "Plain" logical row and column keywords

  - : These keywords refer generally to a grid row or column position. Which keyword sets each is implied by their position in the value — the first value is interpreted as the row/block value, and the second is interpreted as the column/inline value. In each case, you can specify one keyword from each of the two lists to position the element in a single specific grid tile:

    - Keywords with position/direction calculated from the containing block's writing mode:
      - `start`, `center`, or `end`: Position the element in the start, center, or end row in the grid's block direction.
      - `start`, `center`, or `end`: Position the element in the start, center, or end column in the grid's inline direction.
    - Keywords with position/direction calculated from the element's own writing mode:

      - `self-start`, `center`, or `self-end`: Position the element in the start, center, or end row in the grid's block direction.
      - `self-start`, `center`, or `self-end`: Position the element in the start, center, or end column in the grid's inline direction.

      For example, `start end` and `self-start self-end` both place the element at the start of the block direction and the end of the inline direction. With `writing-mode: horizontal-tb` set, this would place the element at the top right of the anchor, whereas with `writing-mode: vertical-rl` set it would place the element at the bottom right.

- "Plain" logical spanning keywords

  - : You can specify one plain logical row or column keyword, and an appropriate plain logical spanning keyword. The element is initially placed in the center of the specified row or column, and it then spans in the direction specified in the spanning keyword, spanning two grid tiles:

    - Keywords with position/direction calculated from the containing block's writing mode:
      - `span-start`: Cause the element to span the center tile and the start tile of the grid row/column.
      - `span-end`: Cause the element to span the center tile and the end tile of the grid row/column.
    - Keywords with position/direction calculated from the element's own writing mode:
      - `span-self-start`: Cause the element to span the center tile and the start tile of the grid row/column.
      - `span-self-end`: Cause the element to span the center tile and the end tile of the grid row/column.

      For example, `start span-end` and `self-start span-self-end` both cause the element to be placed in the center of the start block row, and then spanned across the tiles in that row that are also in the inline center and end columns. With `writing-mode: horizontal-tb` set, this would span the element over the top center and top right of the anchor, whereas with `writing-mode: vertical-rl` set it would span the element over the right center and bottom right.

- "Explicit" logical row and column keywords

  - : These keywords refer explicitly to a block (row) or inline (column) position. In each case, you can specify one keyword from each of the two lists to position the element in a single specific grid tile:

    - Keywords with position/direction calculated from the containing block's writing mode:

      - `block-start`, `center`, or `block-end`: Position the element in the start, center, or end row in the grid's block direction.
      - `inline-start`, `center`, or `inline-end`: Position the element in the start, center, or end column in the grid's inline direction.

      For example, `block-start inline-end` places the element at the start of the block direction and the end of the inline direction. With `writing-mode: horizontal-tb` set, this would place the element at the top right of the anchor, whereas with `writing-mode: vertical-rl` set it would place the element at the bottom right.

      > **Note:** The specification defines `self` equivalents of these keywords — `block-self-start`, `block-self-end`, `inline-self-start`, and `inline-self-end`. However, these are not currently supported in any browser.

- "Explicit" logical spanning keywords

  - : You can specify one explicit logical row or column keyword, and an appropriate explicit logical spanning keyword. The element is initially placed in the center of the specified row or column, and it then spans in the direction specified in the spanning keyword, spanning two grid tiles:

    - Keywords with position/direction calculated from the containing block's writing mode:

      - `span-block-start`: Cause the element to span the center tile and the block start tile of the specified inline column.
      - `span-block-end`: Cause the element to span the center tile and the block end tile of the specified inline column.
      - `span-inline-start`: Cause the element to span the center tile and the inline start tile of the specified block row.
      - `span-inline-end`: Cause the element to span the center tile and the inline end tile of the specified block row.

      For example, `block-end span-inline-start` will cause the element to be placed in the center of the end block row, and then spanned across the tiles in that row that are also in the inline center and start columns. With `writing-mode: horizontal-tb` set, this would span the element over the bottom center and bottom left of the anchor, whereas with `writing-mode: vertical-rl` set it would span the element over the right center and top right.

      > **Note:** The specification defines `self` equivalents of these keywords, for example — `span-self-block-start`, `span-self-block-end`, `span-self-inline-start`, and `span-self-inline-end`. However, these are not currently supported in any browser.

      > **Note:** Trying to pair a row or column keyword with an inappropriate spanning keyword will result in an invalid property value. For example, `block-end span-block-end` is invalid — you can't place the element in the block-end row and then try to span one tile further past the block end.

If only a single logical keyword is specified in the `inset-area` value, the other value is implied as follows:

- `start`, `end`, `self-start`, or `self-end`
  - : The other value defaults to the same as the first value, causing the element to sit in the start row and column, or the end row and column.
- `span-start`/`span-self-start` and `span-end`/`span-self-end`
  - : The other value defaults to `center`. For example, `span-start` is equivalent to `span-start center`.
- `block-start`, `block-end`, `inline-start`, `inline-end`
  - : The other value defaults to [`span-all`](#span-all), causing the element to span all three tiles of the column or row it was initially placed in. For example, `block-start` is equivalent to `block-start span-all`.
- `span-block-start`, `span-block-end`, `span-inline-start`, `span-inline-end`
  - : The other value defaults to `center`. For example, `span-inline-start` is equivalent to `span-inline-start center`.

#### Coordinate grid keywords

These keywords specify the position of the element on the `inset-area` grid using x- and y-coordinate values. Its position/direction will be affected by {{cssxref("writing-mode")}} and/or {{cssxref("direction")}} settings on either the element itself (the `self` keywords) or the element's [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block) (the non-`self` keywords).

However, it is placed according to the physical axes rather than the block/inline directions:

- For `writing-mode: horizontal-tb` and `vertical-lr`, the x-axis runs left-to-right and the y-axis runs top-to-bottom.
- For `writing-mode: horizontal-tb; direction: rtl` and `writing-mode: vertical-rl`, the x-axis runs right-to-left and the y-axis runs top-to-bottom.

The keywords are as follows:

- Coordinate row and column keywords

  - : In each case, you can specify one keyword from each of the two lists to position the element in a single specific grid tile:

    - Keywords with position/direction calculated from the containing block's writing mode:
      - `x-start`, `center`, or `x-end`: Position the element in the start, center, or end tile along the grid's x-axis.
      - `y-start`, `center`, or `y-end`: Position the element in the start, center, or end tile along the grid's y-axis.
    - Keywords with position/direction calculated from the element's own writing mode:

      - `x-self-start`, `center`, or `x-self-end`: Position the element in the start, center, or end tile along the grid's x-axis.
      - `y-self-start`, `center`, or `y-self-end`: Position the element in the start, center, or end tile along the grid's y-axis.

      For example, `x-end y-start` and `x-self-end y-self-start` both place the element at the end of the x-axis and the start of the y-axis. With `writing-mode: horizontal-tb` set, this would place the element at the top right of the anchor, whereas with `writing-mode: vertical-rl` set it would place the element at the top left.

- Coordinate spanning keywords

  - : You can specify one coordinate row or column keyword, and an appropriate coordinate spanning keyword. The element is initially placed in the center of the specified row or column, and it then spans in the direction specified in the spanning keyword, spanning two grid tiles:

    - `span-x-start`: Cause the element to span the center tile and the x-start tile of the specified y-axis row.
    - `span-x-end`: Cause the element to span the center tile and the x-end tile of the specified y-axis row.
    - `span-y-start`: Cause the element to span the center tile and the y-start tile of the specified x-axis column.
    - `span-y-end`: Cause the element to span the center tile and the y-end tile of the specified x-axis column.

      For example, `y-end span-x-end` causes the element to be placed in the center of the end y-row, and then spanned across the tiles in that row that are also in the x-center and x-end columns. With `writing-mode: horizontal-tb` set, this would span the element over the bottom center and bottom right of the anchor, whereas with `writing-mode: vertical-rl` set it would span the element over the bottom center and bottom left.

      > **Note:** The specification doesn't define separate coordinate `self` spanning keywords, but these are not needed — the spanning keywords can be used with both types of coordinate row and column keywords.

If only a single logical keyword is specified in the `inset-area` value, the other value is implied as follows:

- `x-start`/`x-self-start`, `x-end`/`x-self-end`, `y-start`/`y-self-start`, or `y-end`/`y-self-end`
  - : The other value defaults to [`span-all`](#span-all), causing the element to span all three tiles of the column or row it was initially placed in. For example, `x-start` is equivalent to `x-start span-all`.
- `span-x-start`, `span-x-end`, `span-y-start`, or `span-y-end`
  - : The other value defaults to `center`. For example, `span-start` is equivalent to `span-start center`.

#### `span-all`

`span-all` is a special keyword usable with all of the row and column keywords listed in the sections above. When you specify two values — a row/column keyword and `span-all`, the element is placed in the specified row or column, and it then spans all of the tiles in that row or column.

## Description

`inset-area` provides an alternative to the `anchor()` function for positioning elements relative to anchors. `inset-area` works on the concept of a 3x3 grid of tiles, with the anchor element inside the center tile:

![The inset-area grid, as described below](inset-area.png)

The grid tiles are broken up into rows and columns:

- The three rows are represented by the physical values `top`, `center`, and `bottom`. They also have logical equivalents such as `block-start`, `center`, and `block-end`, and coordinate equivalents — `y-start`, `center`, and `y-end`.
- The three columns are represented by the physical values `left`, `center`, and `right`. They also have logical equivalents such as `inline-start`, `center`, and `inline-end`, and coordinate equivalents — `x-start`, `center`, and `x-end`.

The dimensions of the center tile are defined by the [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block) of the anchor element, while the dimensions of the grid's outer edge are defined by the positioned element's containing block.

`inset-area` property values are composed of one or two keywords, which define the region of the grid the positioned element should be placed inside. To be exact, the containing block of the positioned element is set to the grid area.

For example:

- You can specify a row value and a column value to place the positioned element in that specific grid square — for example `top left` (logical equivalent `start start`) or `bottom center` (logical equivalent `end center`) will place the positioned element in the top-right or bottom center square.
- You can specify a row or column value plus a `span-*` value. The first value specifies the row or column to place the positioned element in, placing it initially in the center, and the other one specifies the amount of that column to span. For example:
  - `top span-left` causes the positioned element to be placed in the top row, and span across the center and left tiles of that row.
  - `block-end span-inline-end` causes the positioned element to be placed in the block end row, and span across the center and inline end tiles of that row.
  - `bottom span-all` causes the positioned element to be placed in the bottom row, and span across the left, center, and right tiles of that row.

### An aside on positioned element width

If the positioned element has not had a specific size set on it, its size will default to its [intrinsic size](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Intrinsic_Size), but it will also be affected by the size of the inset-area grid.

If the positioned element is placed into a corner or side grid square (say with `inset-area: top left`) or is set to span two or more grid squares (for example using `inset-area: bottom span-all`), it will align with the specified grid area but behave as if it has a {{cssxref("width")}} of `max-content` set on it. It is being sized according to its containing block size, which is the size imposed on it when it was set to `position: fixed`. It will stretch as wide as the text content, although it may also be constrained by the edge of the `<body>`.

If the positioned element is vertically aligned with the center tile (say with `inset-area: bottom center`), it will align with the specified grid square but adopt the same width as the anchor element — it is being sized according to the anchor element's containing block size. However, it won't allow its content to overflow — its minimum `width` will be its `min-content` (as defined by the width of its longest word).

### Adjusted default behavior

When an `inset-area` value is set on a positioned element, some of its properties have their default behavior adjusted to provide a good default alignment.

#### Self-alignment property `normal` value

The `normal` value of the self-alignment properties ({{cssxref("align-items")}}, {{cssxref("align-self")}}, {{cssxref("justify-items")}}, and {{cssxref("justify-self")}}) behaves as either `start`, `end`, or `anchor-center`, depending on the positioning of the element:

- If the `inset-area` value specifies the center region in an axis, the default alignment in that axis is `anchor-center`.
- Otherwise, the behavior is the opposite of the region it specifies. For example, if the `inset-area` value specifies the start region of its axis, the default alignment in that axis is `end`.

For example, if the `writing-mode` is set to `horizontal-tb`, `inset-area: span-x-start top` resolves to the "start" region of the vertical axis, and the "start" and "center" regions of the horizontal axis. The default alignments will therefore be `align-self: end` and `justify-self: anchor-center`.

#### Auto inset values

Any [inset properties](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/anchor#properties_that_accept_anchor_function_values) set to `auto` will behave as if their value was set to `0`.

### `inset-area` value comparison

Let's show some of the `inset-area` values in action. This demo creates an anchor and tethers a positioned element to it. It also provides a drop-down menu that allows you to choose various `inset-area` values to apply to the positioned element, to see their effect. One of the options causes a text field to appear that enables you to enter a custom value. Finally, a checkbox is provided that can be used to turn a vertical `writing-mode` on and off, allowing you to observe how `inset-area` value effects differ across different writing modes.

#### HTML

In the HTML, we specify two {{htmlelement("div")}} elements, one with a class of `anchor` and one with a class of `infobox`. These are intended to be the anchor element and the positioned element we will associate with it, respectively.

we've also included two forms that contain the {{htmlelement("select")}} and [`<input type="text">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text) elements for setting different `inset-area` values, and the [`<input type="checkbox">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox) element for toggling the vertical {{cssxref("writing-mode")}} on and off.

```html
<div id="anchor-container">
  <div class="anchor">⚓︎</div>

  <div class="infobox">
    <p>This is an information box.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<form id="inset-area-form">
  <div>
    <label for="inset-area-select">Choose an inset-area:</label>
    <select id="inset-area-select" name="inset-area-select">
      <optgroup label="Enter custom value">

        <option>y-start span-x-end</option>
      </optgroup>
      <optgroup label="Coordinates, span all">
        <option>x-start span-all</option>
        <option>y-end</option>
      </optgroup>
    </select>
  </div>
  <div id="inset-area-custom-container">
    <label for="inset-area-custom">Enter a custom inset-area:</label>
    <input type="text" id="inset-area-custom" name="inset-area-custom" />
  </div>
</form>

<form id="writing-mode-form">
  <label for="writing-mode-checkbox">writing-mode: vertical-lr</label>
  <input
    type="checkbox"
    id="writing-mode-checkbox"
    name="writing-mode-checkbox" />
</form>
```

#### CSS

In the CSS, we first declare the `anchor` `<div>` as an anchor element by setting an anchor name on it via the {{cssxref("anchor-name")}} property:

```css hidden
.anchor {
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  text-align: center;
  color: white;
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px black;
  background-color: hsl(240 100% 75%);
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  line-height: 50px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 3px;
}

html {
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

form {
  background: white;
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 5px;
  position: fixed;
}

#inset-area-form {
  top: 0;
  right: 2px;
}

#inset-area-form div:last-child {
  margin-top: 10px;
}

#inset-area-form div :last-child {
  margin-top: 5px;
}

#writing-mode-form {
  bottom: 0;
  left: 2px;
  writing-mode: horizontal-tb;
}

select,
#inset-area-custom {
  display: block;
}

#inset-area-custom-container {
  display: none;
}
```

```css
.anchor {
  anchor-name: --infobox;
}
```

The positioned element is associated with the anchor element by setting its anchor name as the value of the positioned element's `position-anchor` property. We also set the positioned element's:

- {{cssxref("position")}} property to `fixed`, so it can be positioned relative to the anchor's position on the page.
- {{cssxref("opacity")}} property to `0.8`, so that when the positioned element is given an `inset-area` value that places it over the top of the anchor, you can still see what position it is in.
- `inset-area` to `top-left`; this acts as a default value that will be overridden when new values are selected from the `<select>` menu.

```css hidden
.infobox {
  color: darkblue;
  background-color: azure;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  padding: 20px 10px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

```css
.infobox {
  position-anchor: --infobox;
  position: fixed;
  opacity: 0.8;
  inset-area: top left;
}
```

#### JavaScript

The JavaScript does the following:

- Runs {{domxref("Event.preventDefault", "preventDefault()")}} on the first form's [`submit`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event) event object when the form is submitted (i.e. by pressing Enter after entering a value into the text input), to stop it from clearing the page.
- Sets a [`change`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event) event listener on the `<select>` so that when a new `inset-area` value is chosen, it is applied to the positioned element.
- Sets a [`change`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event) event listener on the text input so that when a custom `inset-area` value is entered into it, it is applied to the positioned element.
- Sets a [`change`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event) event listener on the checkbox so that when it is checked and unchecked, the vertical writing mode is toggled on and off.

```js
const anchorContainer = document.querySelector("#anchor-container");
const infobox = document.querySelector(".infobox");

const insetAreaForm = document.querySelector("#inset-area-form");
const selectElem = document.querySelector("select");
const inputElemContainer = document.querySelector(
  "#inset-area-custom-container",

#### Result

The result is as follows. Try selecting new `inset-area` values from the `<select>` menu to see the effect they have on the position of the infobox. Select the "Custom" value and try entering some custom `inset-area` values into the text input to see their effect. Finally, check the checkbox and then experiment with different `inset-area` values to see which ones give the same result across different writing modes, and which ones give different results.
